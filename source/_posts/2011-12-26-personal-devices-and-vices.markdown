I want the ipad to work like a magazine or a newspaper. 
A personal 

My dad bought an iPad for my mom. I were available for tech support and training.

We setup my mom but my dad wanted his email and photos and iCloud too. Well the iPad doesn't work like that. It's a person device, meant for one person. 

Let's say I have a subscription to the new Yorker and its delivered to my house. That subscription is actually for the entire household, as it sits in the living room. 

To treat an iPad this way would mean giving up some part of privacy, email, shared passwords etc. There may not be an issue with this in some house holds. My mom and dad are happy to share the thing, but I know their experience is not the same or as fluid as if thru had user accounts. 

This is most likely solved by adding user account like on a mac. But I think there is a greater discussion here. In that these devices will become out content medium, how does transference work?
