Iteration, 

We typically fill the void of our indecision with the busy work and perception of moving forward, meanwhile, we're not thinking or making real descisions. 

We are wrapped up in how much we have accomplished and that alone validate moving forward. IE, we've invested money or time, and feel we need to persevere to substantiate that investment. 

In error, we make a decision regarding the goal of the project, based solely on what we're invested. "I'm in this deep, might as well continue." But this is dumb, it has nothing to do with the project, its a completely foreign variable in a equation of any decision made in a project or business.
