**Making websites is more like culinary arts than design.** 

The thing that has always given me trepidation about web design is the need to showcase and create an everlasting experience of a singular piece of design or art. 

I had come from printed works on archival paper and crafted prints and paintings in frames displayed on walls. Even the discipline of print design has a reprise where the design can be experienced out side it's given context. IE hanging adverts from the 50s on your wall as art. 

There is no and never will be an equivalent of this in web design. There isn't a permanence of any kind, it has no place. 

In this sense, web design is like cuisine. It is experienced, and then destroyed except for the memory of what it was. 

Tastes of the web
