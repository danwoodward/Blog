We recently had the opportunity to move to a new office space, sharing the risk with another company ( some good friends of ours). 

We danced around it for awhile, and the costs just started to add up and we stepped back and asked why are we doing this. What does it do better than what we currently have. The short answer is nothing. There were a lot of things that started the the word 'when'. When we have more employees this will be great. When we need to do larger presentations that would be great. But these are all things that we arent currently doing. And as a company, as we move forward, increasingly we strive to be MVC, minimum viable company, or lean startup. We do consider ourselves a startup, although we do varied client work, our model is based on investment and return.
